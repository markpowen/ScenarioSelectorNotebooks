This project contains two Jupyter notebooks, which demonstrate how to use the ScenarioSelector algorithm. The scenario selection algorithm selects a maximal subset of scenarios from a scenario set<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>, so that the selected scenarios have specified means (or sums).

## Package Installation

The Python scenarioselector package is published on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/scenarioselector/), and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/markpowen/ScenarioSelectorPython). The package can be installed with the [Package Installer for Python](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

```
pip install scenarioselector
```

## Demonstrations

The demo notebooks in this repository can be viewed with the [Jupyter NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/markpowen/ScenarioSelectorNotebooks/tree/master/).

* [Demo 1: Selecting Scenarios from a Monte Carlo Simulation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/markpowen/ScenarioSelectorNotebooks/blob/master/demo1.ipynb);
* [Demo 2: Selecting Scenarios of Bivariate Data](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/markpowen/ScenarioSelectorNotebooks/blob/master/demo2.ipynb).

## Footnotes

1. A scenario set is a set of (possibly weighted) observations of multi-variate data.
